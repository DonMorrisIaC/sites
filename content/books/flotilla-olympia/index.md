With the help of a pioneering AI, thousands of starry-eyed pilgrims blast themselves out of the solar system in search of a new home. But things go disastrously wrong on the starship Olympia when a deadly malfunction forces the settlers to decelerate in the vast reaches of outer space with nothing but what the gods and innovation can provide.

Ruby Ward wakes from hypersleep into a fleet of spacecraft carving out a life in deep space. It doesn’t take her long to settle into an undemanding routine, but not everyone shares her carefree outlook. A desire for solid ground and a simmering unrest have brought about a splinter group that threatens the Flotilla’s fragile peace.

They call themselves the Titans, and as their sabotage grows bolder each day, Ruby has no choice but to act. She will have to abandon her easy-going habits to save the remote pocket of life she calls home, unaware of the unfathomable forces she might unleash.
