            "summary": "With the help of a pioneering AI, thousands of starry-eyed pilgrims blast themselves out of the solar system in search of a new home. But things go disastrously wrong on the starship Olympia when a deadly malfunction forces the settlers to decelerate in the vast reaches of outer space with nothing but what the gods and innovation can provide. Ruby Ward wakes from hypersleep into a fleet of spacecraft carving out a life in deep space. It doesn’t take her long to settle into an undemanding routine, but not everyone shares her carefree outlook. A desire for solid ground and a simmering unrest have brought about a splinter group that threatens the Flotilla’s fragile peace. ​​​​​They call themselves the Titans, and as their sabotage grows bolder each day, Ruby has no choice but to act. She will have to abandon her easy-going habits to save the remote pocket of life she calls home, unaware of the unfathomable forces she might unleash.",
